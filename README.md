# Old Man Winter
Every year there is a gravel bike race in Lyons, CO in February called Old Man Winter Rally. The race must go on - rain, shine, snow or sleet (unless the county cancels it like in 2020!). This year I'll be riding in it and wanted to get an idea of how fast people typically ride it and how the weather tends to affect the race times.

All the results were downloaded from https://www.oldmanwinterrally.com/results and are saved in this repo as csv's.

I used the Visual Crossing Weather API to download weather data for each year: https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/blog/how-to-load-historical-weather-data-using-python-without-scraping/
